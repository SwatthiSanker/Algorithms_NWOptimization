Analysis of Algorithms - Course Project

This is a Readme file with the steps to run the code.

Steps:
1. In command prompt/terminal, type "./run.sh".

Note: The code can be run in a single step. The run.sh file is a script which calls "make all" to
build the executable file. It then automatically runs the created executable.

The output/results are populated in a file "output1.txt".
